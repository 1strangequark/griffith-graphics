### What to expect
This project simulates the griffith observatory in Los Angeles, California. It contains a 3D model of the observatory on top of a hill. 
The observatory has a garden in front of it, a model of the Hollywood sign to the left of the model, and a cityscape behind the model. 
Users can see the time of day change and during nighttime can see the street lights come on, the building texture change, and the stars
come out. Users can also change the weather of the scene to physics simulated rain, snow, or fog. Finally, users can move the camera around
the scene or choose to have the camera orbit the model to see all of the detail without having to move the camera manually

Controls:
1. Speed up and slow down the day / night cycle.
2. Change the camera between the stating position (Free movement) and Orbit around the observatory.
3. Respawn the buildings.
4. Increase / decrease the number of buildings.
5. Toggle rain, snow, or fog physics simulation. 
6. Speed up / slow down time for the weather physics simulation.
7. Move around the scene.
